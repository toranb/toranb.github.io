<p>Last month at <a href="http://emberconf.com/" target="_blank">EmberConf</a> I ran a workshop on test driven development. Each time I do a training event like this I get a handful of great questions and this time around was no different. I got so many great questions that I decided it was time to blog about a few of the repeat offenders.

<p>The question for this blog post is centered around component integration testing. If you have a simple component that takes in some users and a closure action, how can you assert the action is wired up correctly without including the outter context (parent/container component or controller).</p>

<p>Integration testing makes this such a snap (once we get the syntax down correctly) because you can pass in anything we want (no mock or spy required).</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2016/04/17/integration-testing-dynamic-templates-and-the-component-helper/">next post</a> I'll show how you can inject a custom template to test a custom component helper with integration testing!</p>
