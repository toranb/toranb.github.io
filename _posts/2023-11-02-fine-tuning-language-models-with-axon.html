<p>I spent the last year at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, uncovering the next great opportunity for automation. My talk at <a href="https://2023.elixirconf.com/">ElixirConf US</a> in Orlando documented my attempt at simplifying the complex concepts in neural networks and deep learning for those who feel overwhelmed by the technical aspects.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven/">FizzBuzz</a> because it was a problem most software engineeers had some familiarity with while subtly bridging the gap to more complex concepts. In my experience this widely known interview question was the perfect primer on the subject because underneath the diverse solutions was a well-understood classification problem that provided the optimal foundation for machine learning.</p>

<p>After the more introductory concepts I discussed fine-tuning pre-trained models, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, for the specific task of text classification. I talk about creating a labeled dataset, transforming text into a form these models understand through tokenization and embedding, and finally, training the model. In this part of the talk I emphasize the critical role of quality data, the challenges that come with preparing or cleaning it, and the nuances of encoding text for machine learning models.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the talk I spoke about the trend towards off-the-shelf, open source models, and the opportunities for developers to upskill. For those eager to delve deeper, I recommend <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning">Grokking Deep Learning</a> as an invaluable resource.</p>

<p>My goal was to make deep learning and model fine-tuning more approachable, especially for those in the Elixir community and more generally those new to machine learning. While this talk was presented at ElixirConf I actually think it's applicable to a much wider audience and hope others find it helpful.</p>

<p>Looking back, this journey has been about more than just acquiring knowledge; it's about sharing it, making the path less intimidating, and most importantly, showing how software engineering and machine learning collide to make way for innovative in business.</p>
