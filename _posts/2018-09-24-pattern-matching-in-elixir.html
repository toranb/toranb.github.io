<p>Earlier this year I started learning <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> but for whatever reason I didn't blog about it or write much software to document the learning process. In the past when I would learn something new I'd jump into code and build something straight away. This time around I decided to stretch myself and learn only by reading about the language, platform and ecosystem.</p>

<p>I'm finally making my way back to the language after a few months off and decided I would blog about my experience. I'll be reading the <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6">programming elixir 1.6 book</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/pragdave">Dave Thomas</a> and taking notes. Unlike my previous writing style I plan to make this go round less formal so I can focus more on the language and my journey through it.</p>

<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>The equals operator in Elixir is not about assignment, but rather matching. It succeeds if Elixir can find a way to make the left side equal the right side.</p>

<code>a = 1</code>

<p>Elixir can make the match true by binding the variable a to value 1</p>

<code>a = 1</code>
<code>1 = a</code>
<code>2 = a</code>

<p>The last statement above results in a match error. it's like asserting 2 = 1</p>

<p>Also, Elixir will only change the value of the variable on the left side of an equal sign.</p>

<code>[a, b, c] = list</code>

<p>Variables will bind only once per match</p>

<code>[a, a] = [1, 1]</code>
<code>[b, b] = [1, 2]</code>

<p>The last statement above results in a match error because b cannot have 2 different values.</p>

<p>After you assign a variable it will never change (immutability at work). But you may re-bind that variable like so ...</p>

<code>a = 1</code>
<code>[a, b, c] = [3, 2, 1]</code>

<p>You could force Elixir not to re-bind a variable by using the pin operator.</p>

<code>[a^, b, c] = [3, 2, 1]</code>

<p>This statement would result in a match error if a was already assigned the value of 1</p>

<code>[a^, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]</code>

<p>This statement would NOT result in a match error if a was already assigned the value of 1</p>
