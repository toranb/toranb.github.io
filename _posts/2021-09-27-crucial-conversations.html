<p>This week I started a new role and for the first time I've put team health at the forefront by re-reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822">Crucial Conversations</a> with the specific purpose of gifting the book and a summary of it to each of my engineers. What follows is my paraphrased summary of the book, excluding the last 2 chapters, for those who might find the topic interesting.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>The ability to talk openly about high stakes, emotional, controversial topics</p>
<p>The key skill of effective teams is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and risky issues</p>
<p>Despite the importance of this skill we often avoid these difficult conversations</p>
<p>When we do engage our default response is often self defeating because </p>
<ul>
  <li>We’ve not had great role models to draw from in our personal or professional lives</li>
  <li>The reasoning capacity of our brain is cut in half as adrenaline starts pumping</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to step back from the content and manage the flow of conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Why study this topic? We only have 3 outcomes when faced with a crucial conversation</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can avoid them</li>
  <li>We can have them and handle them poorly</li>
  <li>We can have them and handle them well</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>The key to crucial conversations is effective dialog</p>
<p>Dialog: the free flow of meaning between 2 or more people</p>
<p>To be effective in dialog we seek to get all relevant information out into the open</p>
<p>Beware: the fools choice may encourage silence -between telling the truth and loosing a friend</p>
<p>At the beginning of a crucial conversation we usually don’t share the same pool of meaning</p>
<p>As the pool of shared meaning grows</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better choices can be made because those involved have more relevant information </li>
  <li>With input from everyone you get increased ownership and unity for actions that follow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>To start, take a long hard look at yourself and recognize the role you play in dialog</p>
<p>As much as others may need to change, the only person we can directly change is ourself</p>
<p>Under fire we naturally resist complexity and stop adding to the pool of meaning</p>
<p>When emotions run high we swap our original motive for “winning” or even “punishing”</p>
<p>As you feel your motives shift ask yourself “what do I really want here?”</p>
<p>Sometimes we choose personal safety over dialog by choosing silence</p>
<p>We accept the certainty of bad results to avoid the possibility of uncomfortable conversation</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>Dialog requires safety for all involved</p>
<p>People will not add to the shared pool of meaning when they do not feel safe</p>
<p>Learn to look for safety problems (dual processing) while in the conversation</p>
<p>Beware: watching for conditions (ie: safety) and content at the same time takes practice</p>
<p>People become defensive because of fear (the condition) not the content itself</p>
<p>The problem is not the message, but when we fail to help others feel safe hearing the message</p>
<p>You can absorb threatening feedback when you respect their opinion and trust their motives</p>
<p>When you remove fear the brain can function with full reasoning capacity</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>Safety requires commitment to a shared mutual purpose (the entry condition)</p>
<p>To stay in dialog we need to maintain mutual respect (the continuance condition)</p>
<p>When necessary, step out of the content, make it safe, then step back into the conversation</p>
<p>Beware: don’t sugar coat or water down your message</p>

<p>The 4 skills to establish a mutual purpose</p>
<ul>
  <li>commit to seek mutual purpose (check your heart)</li>
  <li>Recognize the purpose behind the strategy</li>
  <li>Invent a mutual purpose</li>
  <li>Brainstorm new strategies that serve all involved</li>
</ul>

<p>To establish respect when violated</p>
<ul>
  <li>apologize if you’ve truly disrespected someone</li>
  <li>If respect was broken by misunderstanding, use contrasting to clarify the purpose or intent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>Emotions don’t just happen</p>
<p>We feel something because of a thought we ourselves create</p>
<p>We generally tell ourselves a story with partial information</p>
<p>These “stories” help us give meaning so we can justify</p>

<p>Once you’ve created the emotions you have 2 choices</p>
<p>1) You can act on them</p>
<p>2) Or be acted on by them</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To challenge the emotional response or story ask “what evidence do I have that supports this?”</p>
<p>Beware: don’t confused stories with facts</p>

<p>We generally tell 3 diff stories</p>
<ul>
<li>Victim stories "not my fault"</li>
<li>Villain stories "they have bad motives"</li>
<li>Helpless stories "I’m powerless"</li>
</ul>

<p>Relax your absolute certainty long enough for dialog -the only reliable way to discover motive</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>Speak honestly but with confidence, humility and skill</p>
<p>Share the facts, not the conclusions</p>
<p>Invite opposing views</p>
<p>Tell your story (be sure this follows the facts)</p>
<p>Ask for others paths</p>
<p>Talk tentatively</p>
<p>Encourage testing (of your views and opinions)</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>The best way to influence is to use your ears</p>
<p>When you invite others to share, you must mean it</p>
<p>Be curious, ask questions to seek understanding</p>
<p>Beware: we often start to insert incorrect motives</p>
<p>When you sense this^ ask “why would a sane, rational person say this?”</p>
<p>Retrace aloud -the other persons path to action (after you hear them explain it)</p>
<p>Work to curb your reaction and return to the facts/story/emotion to seek understanding</p>

<p>4 powerful listening skills</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask them to share their opinion</li>
  <li>Mirror -when their tone or body language doesn’t match their words mirror it back to them</li>
  <li>Paraphrase -repeat it back to clarify your own understanding</li>
  <li>Prime -sometimes we pour into the shared pool to encourage them to do the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind we are trying to understand their point of view -not necessarily agree with it</p>
<p>Beware: its what you say and how you say it (keep your tone top of mind as you repeat back)</p>

<p>Agree when you agree (don’t waste time debating if you don’t disagree)</p>
<p>Build when key pieces of information are left out -grow the pool of shared meaning</p>
<p>Compare when you differ and be open minded</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>Decision making should be decided on up front ahead of the dialog itself</p>
<p>To not violate expectations make it clear how the final decision will be made</p>
<p>4 ways to make decisions (increasing degree of involvement)</p>
<ul>
  <li>command - no involvement just delegate it</li>
  <li>Consult -invite others to influence the decision</li>
  <li>Vote - when several great options are present</li>
  <li>Consensus -most involved but required when a unanimous decision is necessary </li>
<ul>

<p>To decide ask a few questions</p>
<ul>
  <li>who cares? don’t invite people who aren’t involved</li>
  <li>Who knows about his information? (to help with the shared pool, and decision making)</li>
  <li>Who must agree to decide?</li>
  <li>How many people is it worth involving</li>
<ul>

<p>You want to avoid violated expectations and inaction (hold people accountable to promises)</p>
