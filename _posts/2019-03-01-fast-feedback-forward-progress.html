<p>After my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b1vcg_XSR8">last talk</a> got some traction a few years ago I took an unintentional hiatus from conference speaking. Luckily, in September last year I had the opportunity to talk about the role fast feedback plays in my day-to-day. I recently got word that the recording from that event is available online and I couldn't be more proud to share it!</p>
