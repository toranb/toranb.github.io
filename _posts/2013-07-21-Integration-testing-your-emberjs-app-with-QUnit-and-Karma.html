<p>When <a href='http://emberjs.com/'>ember.js</a> RC3 was released back in April, it <a href='http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/04/21/ember-1-0-rc3.html'>included</a> an official ember-testing package that aimed to fill the integration testing void in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>I didn't jump in head first initially because I was still trying to use jasmine for everything and felt the switch to QUnit would be painful (shows how little I knew about either framework). But after I spent some time unit testing ember.js components with QUnit, I started playing around with the ember-testing package and now I can't say enough good things about it. I think of it like using all the good parts of selenium without any of the slow feedback cycle.</p>

<p>I decided to do a short screencast on the subject to show people how to use it for both unit and integration testing. I also show how to run your QUnit tests with the <a href='http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html'>karma</a> test runner (with some help from the <a href='https://github.com/toranb/karma-ember-preprocessor'>ember-karma-preprocessor</a> plugin to precompile any handlebars templates)</p>
