<p>This year I read <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>, <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book">Team Topologies</a> and a slightly more academic book on the topic of lean called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6278270-the-principles-of-product-development-flow">The Principles of Product Development Flow</a> in an effort to learn more about delivery engineering. After weeks of careful study, I combined my takeaways with some practical work experience to produce a talk on the subject.</p>
