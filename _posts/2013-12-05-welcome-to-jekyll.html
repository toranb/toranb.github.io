<p>I finally decided to quit hosting my blog and give Jekyll + Github Pages a try. It took a solid 4 hours to transition each post from a hard-coded MySQL INSERT statement to something that would work out of the box ... but it appears to be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I need to give the theme some love in the coming weeks, but this should be a great start!</p>
