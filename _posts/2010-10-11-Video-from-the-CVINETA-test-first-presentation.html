<p>I wanted to thank the <a href='http://www.cvineta.org/'>Cedar Valley .NET User Group</a> for hosting me last week as I attempted to convert everyone to a 'test-first' ninja. Although the technical part of my presentation was already <a href='http://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2010/10/04/Building-Something-Real-Test-First-Screencast-Series'>online</a> in the form of a screencast series, I did take video of the presentation itself and thought to share it.</p>

<p>I only kept the first 17 minutes or so because the technical part of the talk was impossible to follow due to the lighting and my video quality. But if you are interested in watching me talk about why I decided to give this talk and some of the benefits found when writing software test-first you can find the mp4 <a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/presentations/2010/BuildingSomethingRealTestFirst.mp4'>here</a>.</p>

<p>To everyone who provided feedback at the presentation, thank you! I'm always looking to improve and live coding during a technical talk is always an adventure!</p>
