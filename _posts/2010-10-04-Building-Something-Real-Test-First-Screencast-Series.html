<p>I finally decided to publish an 11 part series dedicated to real world test-first development.  In this series I start development of a very simple blog engine using both Fitnesse and MS Test to drive out the design.  Throughout the series I focus on simplicity, design fundamentals, acceptance testing, unit testing, and refactoring.  I learned a lot during the series and hope to pass along something of value to another developer who might be interested in the test-first paradigm.</p>

<p>I will blog about each part of the series independently but for now I wanted to get the mp4 links posted for those who might find the content of interest.</p>
