<p>Finishing the simple blog implementation does require a one-to-many relationship between posts and comments.  So first we need to add the comment object and scaffold out the view/migration/etc.</p>

<h3>Scaffold Comments</h3>

<pre>rails generate scaffold Comment post_id:integer body:text</pre>

<p>Next you need to setup the mysql table for comments</p>

<pre>rake db:migrate</pre>

<p>After you have this complete, you need to modify the comment model found under app/model</p>

<pre>belongs_to :post</pre>

<p>Next you need to modify the post model object found under app/model</p>

<pre>has_many :comments</pre>

<h3>Alter your views to reflect this new relationship</h3>

<p>Add the following to your show.html.erb template found under app/views/posts</p>

<p>Now in your comments controller modify the create method found under app/controllers</p>

<p>Also add this to the post controller show method to ensure we have a collection of comments for each post to show</p>

<pre>@comments = @post.comments</pre>

<p>And finally alter your routes file to look like the below found under config/routes.rb</p>

<img src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/images/routes.jpg' alt='blog routes'/>

<p>now fire up the web server and try to add a comment</p>

<pre>rails server</pre>

<p>You should now have a working blog with both a many-to-many and now a one-to-many relationship!</p>
