<p>Any rails screencast will usually show a simple blog example to get you started.  But often they skip the many-to-many relationship and jump to the less complex one-to-many implementation of comments and posts.  I instead wanted to start with the seemingly more difficult many tags to many posts relationship.</p>

<h3>Scaffold out the objects and join table</h3>

<p>First create a new rails application using a MySQL backend</p>

<pre>rails new blog -d mysql</pre>

<p>Change to the directory of your new rails app</p>

<pre>cd blog</pre>

<p>Next we need to scaffold out the post and tag objects</p>

<pre>rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text</pre>
<pre>rails generate scaffold Tag description:string</pre>

<p>But this is where it gets a little tricky. Rails won't build the many-to-many join table so you will need to generate a specific migration that will hold these primary key values</p>

<pre>rails generate migration create_posts_tags_join</pre>

<p>After you have this file created you need to alter it.  You can find this file under db/migrate/.  It Should be named something like 0000000_create_posts_tags_join.rb.  It's important to note that you must put these in alpha order ( ie p comes before t )</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class CreatePostsTagsJoin < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table 'posts_tags', :id => false do |t|
      t.column 'post_id', :integer
      t.column 'tag_id', :integer
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table 'posts_tags'
  end
end
</pre>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next in the post model add the following.  This can be found under app/models</p>

<pre>has_and_belongs_to_many :tags</pre>

<p>And in the tag model add the following</p>

<pre>has_and_belongs_to_many :posts</pre>

<p>And finally do <b>rake db:create</b> followed by <b>rake db:migrate</b> from the command line to get your database setup correctly.</p>

<h3>Alter your views to reflect this relationship</h3>

<p>To get a working view first edit your _form.html.erb to include a checkbox of tags. This can be found under app/views/posts/</p>

<img src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/images/tagmarkupform.jpg' alt='tag markup form'/>

<p>Next in the controller you need to add a variable for each element using the form. You can find this class under app/controllers/</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def edit
  @tags = Tag.all
  ...
end

def new
  @tags = Tag.all
  ...
end
</pre>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next alter the show.html.erb so we can see each tag for a given post - found under app/views/posts</p>

<img src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/images/tagmarkupshow.jpg' alt='tag markup show'/>

<p>Next you need to add a line to your show controller action that returns only the tags for a given post - again the posts_controller</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    @tags = @post.tags

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.xml  { render :xml => @post }
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And one last tweak to fix an issue with a 'no many-to-many' update.  Alter your update method to show the tag_ids array as null when it's empty.  This will clear the collection from @post when you submit a form post without any tags selected.</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def update
  params[:post][:tag_ids] ||= []
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Lets see this in action.  Fire up the rails web server</p>

<pre>rails server</pre>

<p>Now after you have the above in place go to the url below and add a few tags so we have some to play with</p>

<pre>http://localhost:3000/tags</pre>

<p>Next go to the post url below and add a post, but you should see a checkbox at the bottom that allows you to mark a post with a specific tag</p>

<pre>http://localhost:3000/tags</pre>

<p>Check a few and click update. Next edit it and remove them all.  You now have your first many-to-many relationship working in rails 3</p>
