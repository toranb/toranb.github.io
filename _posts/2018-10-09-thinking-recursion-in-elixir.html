<p>In part 15 of my <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> journey I wanted to start a dialog about recursion.</p>

<h3>Recursion</h3>

<p>The `sum` function should enumerate each item in the list and return the total.</p>

<div class="highlight" data-language="elixir">
  <pre class="language-elixir">
    <code class="language-elixir">defmodule Math do</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">  def sum([]), do: 0</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">  def sum([head | tail]) do</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">    head + sum(tail)</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">  end</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">end</code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>To solve this problem in Elixir I had to think differently. Instead of using a `for loop` like I've done for so many years in imperative languages I had to (re)learn recursion.</p>

<p>Taking a step by step approach I wanted to describe how this `sum` function works in great detail to get a sense of how the program behaves at runtime.</p>

<div class="highlight" data-language="elixir">
  <pre class="language-elixir">
    <code class="language-elixir">Math.sum([1, 2, 3])</code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>1) `head` is the integer `1` and tail is the list `[2, 3]`</p>
<p>2) `head` is the integer `2` and tail is the list `[3]`</p>
<p>3) `head` is the integer `3` and tail is an empty list `[]`</p>
<p>4) empty list `[]` is a match for the first `sum` clause</p>

<p>We can calculate the `sum` of our list by walking through the previous set of instructions in reverse. It's worth mentioning that each time the `sum` function calls itself, it adds to the stack. And when the `sum` function returns it will pop off the stack (hence the reverse order).</p>

<div class="highlight" data-language="elixir">
  <pre class="language-elixir">
    <code class="language-elixir">0 # sum([])</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">3 + 0 # sum([3])</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">2 + 3 # sum([2, 3])</code>
    <code class="language-elixir">1 + 5 # sum([1, 2, 3])</code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>The first call on the stack as we start to unwind executes `sum` with an empty list `[]` and returns the integer `0`. The next call on the stack executes `sum` with the list `[3]` and returns the integer `3` + `0` (prior `sum` result). The next call on the stack executes `sum` with `[2, 3]` and returns the integer `2` + `3` (prior `sum` result). The very last call on the stack invokes `sum` with `[1, 2, 3]` and returns the integer `1` + `5` (prior `sum` result). The final value returned from this `sum` function is `6` (no surprise I hope).</p>

<p>This type of thinking becomes more familiar with time and offers some compelling solutions to a diverse set of problems. One day soon I hope the `for loop` concept becomes so foreign that I reach for recursion straight away.</p>
