<p>For anyone who might be interested, the slide deck for my 'How Test First Development Changed My Life' presentation is available for download <a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/presentations/2010/HowTestFirstDevelopmentChangedMyLife.zip'>here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, I had a friend in the audience take video of the presentation, but because the battery on my camcorder was running low I was only able to get the first 34 minutes or so.  You can stream this <a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716525/content/presentations/2010/TDDChangedMyLife.mp4'>video</a> or download the mp4 directly.</p>

<p>For anyone who was at this talk, I'm very interested in hearing your feedback so please drop me a line to help me improve the next time around :)</p>
