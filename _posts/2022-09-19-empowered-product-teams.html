<p>Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to blend, extend and adapt well known engineering practices to match the accelerated demands put on product teams. After years of trial and error I've become convinced empowerment is at the core of both better product teams and better software.</p>

<p>Truly <a href="">empowered</a> product teams are given more ownership to learn, adapt and respond to feedback. With this ownership comes a responsibility that requires a combination of discovery, experimentation, and delivery. Engineering teams must then focus on outcomes instead of output, which better equips them to organize, shape and sequence the work.</p>

<p>A strong product team must navigate uncertainty. Yet too often, we find ourselves crammed into a framework that views software creation not as a journey of discovery, but as a fixed process with segregated roles. By embracing this new approach to knowledge work, software careers can be more fulfilling, rewarding, and impactful.</p>
