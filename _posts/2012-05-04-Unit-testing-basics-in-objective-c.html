<p>Tomorrow I'm giving my first in depth objective-c talk on unit testing and I decided to produce a screencast of the content for those who can't make the event.</p>

<p>I decided to keep this presentation religion free and to the point. I wanted to show unit testing in action from the very basic substring examples to parsing JSON. This along with a light introduction to the <a href='http://ocmock.org/'>ocmock</a> library proved to be more than enough content for a 60 minute unit testing introduction.</p>

<p>As always, if you want the code from this presentation you can find it on <a href='https://github.com/toranb/unit-testing-objective-c'>github</a>.</p>
