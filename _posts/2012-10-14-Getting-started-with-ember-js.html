<p><b>Update 03/02/2013</b></p>

<p>I recorded this screencast when ember was still in it's infancy so most of what you see below is obsolete. I did record an update recently to include the RC1 build of emberjs. You can find that screencast <a href='/blog/archive/2013/03/02/emberjs-rc1-introduction-screencast/'>here</a></p>

<p>-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --</p>

<p>I decided to go a little overboard and give my ember.js talk 3 times in the next 30 days. And like usual I try to produce a screencast of the live coding content for those who can't make the event in person.</p>

<p>If you want the code from this presentation you can find it on <a href='https://github.com/toranb/ember-code-camp'>github</a>. I tried to do a commit with each new concept so it should be easy to follow along with.</p>

<p>Whether you make it to the event in person or you just watch this screencast directly, leave a comment with some feedback to help me improve it next time around!</p>
