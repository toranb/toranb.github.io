<p>The first time I went to publish an Android app it was unclear how to export an apk. I also thought if the app was free I wouldn't need to do anything special to the final apk, but as it turns out you still need to sign the apk before the google market will let you upload it.</p>

<p>The video below is a simple walk through showing how to version/build/sign/export your apk for the google market. It's under 5 minutes and straight to the point.</p>
