<p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iZIZHgHa5M">ElixirConf</a> I found myself increasingly immersed in the world of fine-tuning. This curiosity soon led me on a journey to explore various use cases, eventually drawing me into the realm of synthetic dataâ€”a journey that spanned several months.</p>

<p>One pivotal moment in this exploration was <a href="https://edwarddonner.com/2024/01/11/fine-tune-llama-for-text-messages-part-1">a post by Edward Donner</a> that detailed his experience training a language model to mimic his own texting style. The majority of my time was soon dedicated to cleaning raw text message data to create a high-quality dataset for fine-tuning.</p>

<p>While the core of my talk was focused on synthetic data generation, I also delved into the intricacies of fine-tuning with <a href="https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth">Unsloth</a>, evaluation strategies, and even model deployment using <a href=""https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx>Nx</a>. I owe much of the data generation technique I discussed to <a href="https://x.com/jon_durbin">Jon Durbin</a>, whose DPO approach was instrumental in shaping my work. Lastly, a big thank you to <a href="https://paraxial.io/">Paraxial IO</a> for giving me the opportunity to share my insights!</p>

<p>The python source code for fine tuning with unsloth is on <a href="https://github.com/toranb/sloth">Github</a> for anyone interested. I also put the elixir code for the <a href="https://github.com/toranb/mistral-chat-f16">chat app</a> shown in the talk on Github.</p>
