<p>On November 1st I joined the first <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">RAG</a> cohort from <a href="https://mlops.community/">MLOps.Community</a> and went hard for 8 weeks building a proof of concept that combined everything from <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings">embedding models</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/prompt-eng">prompting</a>, and retrieval to <a href="https://qdrant.tech/articles/hybrid-search/#the-precise-search-the-re-ranking-strategy">ranking</a> with a cross encoder to support <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/hybrid_search.py#L37-L59">hybrid search</a>.</p>

<p>I want to extend a public "thank you" to <a href="https://twitter.com/RahulParundekar">Rahul Parundekar</a> for all his hard work ahead of the long journey, the consistent encouragement and the 1v1 coaching! If anyone needs a machine learning engineer and coach, don't hesitate to get in touch with Rahul.</p>

<p>I put together a succinct version of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/900118849">final presentation</a> to document my learning, commitments, growth and ultimately to keep me accountable. The entire experience simultaneously energized and propelled me further down the road of machine learning!</p>
