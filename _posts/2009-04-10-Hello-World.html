<p>I have finally decided to make a place for myself in the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere' target='_blank'>Blogosphere</a>!  I realized the only thing holding me back has been this fear of saying the wrong thing ... but the truth about this industry is 'the more you learn, the more you realize you know nothing'.
</p>
<p>
In addition, <a href='http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/' target='_blank'>many</a> of the <a href='http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/' target='_blank'>bloggers</a> I <a href='http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/' target='_blank'>follow</a> <a href='http://devlicio.us/blogs/tim_barcz/' target='_blank'>religiously</a> have been encouraging others to get started -so why not!
</p>
<p>
I plan to write about the craft that is software development because it’s my passion and I often find myself thinking in depth about various topics … yet I never write anything down.  I did finally start a small list of “things” I wanted to discuss in blog form, so if you find me writing about things that seem a bit dated – you will know why.

<p>
All of my day to day work is writing line of business applications on the .NET platform so you might notice a trend … (MS Fanboy) but I’ll do my best to keep an open mind.
