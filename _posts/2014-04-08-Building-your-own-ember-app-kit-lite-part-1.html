<p>Let me quickly introduce the sample application that we will be upgrading throughout this blog series.</p>

</div>

<p>To pull down the static assets I've included bower in the package.json file. To install this in your local directory you can simply type "npm install". The npm install has a post-install hook that will invoke "bower install" to pull down jquery/handlebars/ember locally. These static assets will be stored in the js/vendor folder once bower completes (if you prefer to modify this update the .bowerrc file).</p>

<p>The javascript application itself is very basic and can be found in the js/app.js file. It's nothing more than a "/" route that returns a list of hard coded people.</p>

<p>We include all of the static assets and the above app.js file in the root index.html file. In addition to these static js files, I've also included the handlebars templates with a basic html table that adds a table row for each person in the array.</p>

<p>If you already completed the npm install/bower install steps from above, you can run the python script by typing "./bin/server" from the root of the project. This should host the static directory so you can view the running app at localhost:3000</p>

<p>Now that we have a working application, we can introduce grunt and the other <a href="http://www.toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2014/04/08/Building-your-own-ember-app-kit-lite-part-2/">eak-lite concepts!</a></p>
